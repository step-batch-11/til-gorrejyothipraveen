# Today I Learned

Write **1–3 concrete things** you understood better today.

- What *clicked* today?
- stdin and stdout take the input from the terminal and printing it into terminal (piping is also possible)
- What changed in your understanding?
- stdin replaces the use the prompt ,it provides the efficient way to deal with input taking from the terminal
- What would you explain differently now?
- console.log also internally uses the stdout , understanding internally what is happen helps

# Still Confusing

List **up to 3 things** that are still unclear.

- What almost makes sense but doesn’t fully?
- stdin readable and writable , locker and transformer and controller
- What would you like to see one more example of?
- transformer ,controller, readable and writeable 
- What feels fragile in your understanding?
- Deno.contain lots of subObjects which little difficult to understand

# Questions to Chase

Write **2–5 questions** worth pursuing later.

Rules:
- Questions must be specific
- Avoid yes/no questions

- how does stdin is actually working internally ?
- what is transformer doing ? why we are using it along with pipeThrough

# Tiny Experiments (Optional)

Small things you want to try tomorrow or later.

- A REPL experiment
- why Deno.stdin.readable.getReader().read() show error if i am using it 2 times
