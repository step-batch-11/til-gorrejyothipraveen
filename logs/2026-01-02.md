# Today I Learned

Write **1–3 concrete things** you understood better today.

- What *clicked* today?
  - deno init ,p5 and shell commands
- What changed in your understanding?
  - by using p5 we can do lot of things, mathematics is involved and also which helps us to improve imagination
- What would you explain differently now?
  - working on p5 might helps us to do different kinds of things

# Still Confusing

List **up to 3 things** that are still unclear.

- What almost makes sense but doesn’t fully?
  - shell commands , that syntaxes are not clear to me and also p5 functions (createVector, rotation)
- What would you like to see one more example of?
  - about if conditional statements and loops , few examples on createVector and rotation
- What feels fragile in your understanding?
  - vector , how it works , what is vector etc...

# Questions to Chase

Write **2–5 questions** worth pursuing later.

Rules:
- Questions must be specific
- Avoid yes/no questions

- why it is not giving any output when try every thing in one line ? (shell)

# Tiny Experiments (Optional)

Small things you want to try tomorrow or later.

- i want use nested loops in shell 
- i want to work on p5 
- i want to try test with different parameters

# One-Sentence Summary

Finish this sentence:

> Today was useful because i learned about few shell commands (conditional and loops), deno init(so, don't need to be write every thing manually), p5 (some mathematical information and tricks).
